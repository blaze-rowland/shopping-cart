## Purpose of Project

The purpose of this project isn't really anything special. I'm working on a SQL Library for Node.js called [@forty-boy/sql](https://github.com/blaze-rowland/forty-sql) and I need a reliable, tried and true way of testing it. That's where this project comes in.. This project is to find bugs, needed features, etc for the aforementioned package. If you're interested in learning more or trying that package yourself you can install it via NPM or Yarn [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@forty-boy/sql).

If you are interested in trying the package, just know syntax is destined to change as I progress through this project. There are minor plans to do major rework although, I'll try my best to keep all changes from being breaking ones.
